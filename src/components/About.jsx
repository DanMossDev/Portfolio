      I'm a software developer from the North West with experience in
      JavaScript (including Node.JS and React), HTML/CSS, PostgreSQL, and C#.

      I have a huge passion for creating interesting user experiences. One of
      the first things I did as a developer was create "Tindie", which can
      pretty much be summed up as "Tinder for video games". Building out the
      app in vanilla JS, PSQL, HTML and CSS was a challenge for sure - but one 
      that felt all the more satisfying as features began to work and the
      experience began to flesh out more and more.

      I first got into programming while playing around in Unity - I realised
      that while designing the whole game was indeed fun, the stuff I really
      enjoyed was working on scripts. For me, the satisfaction from finally 
      cracking a difficult problem is second to none!
