      <h1>Moss's Software/Web Dev Journey!</h1>

        <div class="intro">On this website, I will be chronicling my journey to becoming a web developer. While I am writing this, all I have to show is some simple HTML and very basic CSS. In a few weeks, I'm hoping to have a fairly modern looking website!
            <p class="p1">Over the coming weeks there are a few things I intend to learn; such as: 
              <ul>
                <li> HTML5, inside and out</li>
                <li> CSS3 to enough of a degree that I can make things look nice, and do some simple animating</li>
                <li> JavaScript to a high level, good enough to get hired</li>
                <li> React, JQuery, or maybe something like SQL/PHP that will help with getting hired</li>
              </ul>
            </p> 
        </div>

      <p class="p1" style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">I will make new pages for each bit of <strong>more or less significant</strong> progress that I make.</p>
