    <div class="intro">
        <p class="p1">I'm a software developer from the North West with experience in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and C#.<br><br>
            Having retrained in my mid twenties, I am coming into the industry with life experience and a hunger to succeed. I'm comfortable with advanced maths - having studied up to a certificate of higher education in physics; knowledgeable about design and marketing thanks to my degree in communication; and thanks to my government funded reeducation I am equipped to handle the world of software development.<br><br>
            I first got into programming while playing around in Unity - I realised that while designing the whole game was indeed fun, the stuff I really enjoyed was working on scripts. The satisfaction from finally cracking a difficult problem is second to none!<br><br>
            From there, like many people I self studied using resources like FreeCodeCamp and the Odin Project, before applying and being accepted by Northcoders to study under the guidance of their wonderful tutors.
